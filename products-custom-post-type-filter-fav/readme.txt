The provided code is a WordPress small plugin code that performs several tasks mentioned below:

1. Script and Style Registration
2. Custom Post Type Registration
3. Taxonomy Registration
4. Custom Meta Box
5. Shortcode Creation
6. AJAX Filtering
7. Favorite Option


Step by step explanation of the above tasks:

1. Script and Style Registration:
   - The `plugin_register_script` function is call to the `init` action, which is fired when WordPress is initialized.
   - It uses the `wp_enqueue_script` and `wp_enqueue_style` functions to register and enqueue the Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files, Font Awesome CSS file, and a custom JavaScript file called `custom.js`.
   - The `wp_localize_script` function is used to pass the AJAX URL to the `custom.js` file.

2. Custom Post Type Registration:
   - The `product_post_post` function is call to the `init` action to register a custom post type called "Product" using the `register_post_type` function.
   - It defines various labels and settings for the custom post type, such as the post type name, supports (title, editor, thumbnail, etc.), and rewrite rules.

3. Taxonomy Registration:
   - Three separate functions (`product_taxonomies_prodcut`, `product_taxonomies_prodcut_size`, and `product_taxonomies_prodcut_color`) are used to register taxonomies for the custom post type.
   - Each function defines labels and settings for a specific taxonomy (categories, size, and color) using the `register_taxonomy` function.

4. Custom Meta Box:
   - The `wporg_add_pro_price` function is call to the `add_meta_boxes` action to add a custom meta box called "Add Price" to the custom post type.
   - It uses the `add_meta_box` function to define the meta box's ID, title, content callback, and the associated post type.
   - The content callback function `wporg_product_price_html` is responsible for rendering the HTML markup of the meta box.
   - The `wporg_product_price_save_meta` function is hooked to the `save_post` action to save the entered price value as post meta.

5. Shortcode Creation:
   - The `product_shortcode` function defines a shortcode called `[products]` that can be used to display the product items.
   - It uses the `WP_Query` class to retrieve the product posts with specific arguments (post type, number of posts, etc.).
   - The function loops through the retrieved posts and generates HTML markup for each product item.
   - The generated output is stored in the output buffer using `ob_start()` and `ob_get_clean()` functions and returned as the shortcode output.

6. AJAX Filtering:
   - The `product_filter_function` function is hooked to both `wp_ajax_myfilter` and `wp_ajax_nopriv_myfilter` actions to handle AJAX requests for filtering the products.
   - It receives the filter parameters (category, size, color) from the AJAX request.
   - Based on the received parameters, it constructs a new `WP_Query` object with appropriate arguments to retrieve filtered product posts.
   - The function loops through the filtered posts and generates HTML markup for each product item.
   - The generated markup is then sent back as a response to the AJAX request.

7. Favorite Option:
   - The plugin allows users to mark products as favorites.
   - It adds a "Add Favorite" button in product loop.
   - When a user clicks the "Add Favorite" button, the plugin saves the product ID user's cookies. As of now it is storing in cookies but we can store the data in database.
   - The plugin provides a mechanism to display the user's favorite products, typically on a separate page using shortcode ['products_fav'].
   - It retrieves the list of favorite product IDs associated with the user and fetches the corresponding product details to display.



Why I decided to code in this way?

I decided to use the shortcodes  because it provides user-friendly and flexible way where we can add dynamic content to pages without directly modifying theme templates.we can put this shortcode whereever we want to display the product list.
